        What is Configuration Management?
        Configuration management is the process of maintaining software and computer systems (for example servers,
        storage, networks) in a known, desired and consistent state. It also allows access to an accurate historical
        record of system state for project management and audit purposes.
        System Administrators mostly perform repetitive tasks like installing servers, configuring those servers, etc.
        These professionals can automate this task, by writing scripts.

        What is Puppet?
        Puppet is a system management tool for centralizing and automating the configuration management process. Puppet
        is also used as a software deployment tool. It is an open-source configuration management software widely used
        for server configuration, management, deployment, and orchestration of various applications and services across
        the whole infrastructure of an organization.

        Puppet comes in two versions:

        Open Source Puppet:
        It is a basic version of Puppet configuration management tool, which is also known as Open Source Puppet. It is
        available directly from Puppet’s website and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 system

        Puppet Enterprise:
        Commercial version that offers features like compliance reporting,orchestration, role-based access control, GUI,
        API, and command-line tools for effective management of nodes.

        What are Functions of Puppet ?

        Puppet allows you to define distinct configurations for every host.
        The tool allows you to continuously monitor servers to confirm whether the required configuration exists or not
        and it is not altered.
        If the config is changed, Puppet tool will revert to the pre-defined configuration on the
        host.


        Communication between the Master and the Agent:
        Step 1 - Once the connectivity is established between the agent and the master, the Puppet agent sends the data
        about its state to the Puppet master server. These are called Facts: This information includes the hostname,
        kernel details, IP address, file name details, etc




        Step 2
        - Puppet Master uses this data and compiles a list with the configuration to be applied to the agent. This list
        of configuration to be performed on an agent is known as a catalog . This could be changed such as package
        installation, upgrades or removals, File System creation, user creation or deletion, server reboot, IP
        configuration changes, etc.



        Step 3 - The agent uses this list of configuration to apply any required configuration changes on the node.
        In case there are no drifts in the configuration, Agent does not perform any configuration changes and leaves
        the node to run with the same configuration.

        Step 4 - Once it is done the node reports back to puppet master indicating that the configuration has been
        applied and completed.

        Implementation and Output :

        Installation of Puppet on Linux Step 1: 
        Update Package List Before you start the installation process, update the list of available packages:
        sudo apt-get update –y


        Step 2: Set Up Hostname Resolution
        With Puppet, master and client nodes communicate using hostname. Before installing Puppet, you need to set up a
        unique hostname on each node.

        Open the hosts file on each node by using:
        sudo nano /etc/hosts

        Paste the following lines at the end of each hosts file:
        [puppet master ip] puppetmaster puppet [puppet client ip] puppetclient Where:
        [puppet master ip] is the IP address of the master node, and
        [puppet client ip] is the IP address of the client node.

        Press Ctrl + X to close the file, and then type Y and press Enter to save the changes you made.

        Step 3: Install Puppet Server on Master Node
        Download the latest Puppet version on the master node:
        Wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet7-release-focal.deb
        Once the download is complete, install the package by using:
        sudo dpkg -i puppet7-release-focal.deb


        Update the package repository:
        sudo apt-get update -y

        Install the Puppet server with the following command
        sudo apt-get install puppetserver –y

        Open the puppetserver file by using:
        sudo nano /etc/default/puppetserver
        Press Ctrl + X to close the puppetserver file. TypeY and press Enter to save the changes you made.

        Start the Puppet service and set it to launch on system boot by using:
        sudo systemctl start puppetserver
        sudo systemctl enable puppetserver

        Check if the Puppet service is running with:
        sudo systemctl status puppetserver

        Step 4: Install Puppet Agent on Client Node
        1. Download the latest version of Puppet on a client node:
        wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet7-release-focal.deb

        2 . Once the download is complete, install the package by using: sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-focal.deb
        Update the package repository one more time:
        sudo apt-get update -y

        Install the Puppet agent by using:
        Open the Puppet configuration file:
        sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

        Add the following lines to the end of the Puppet configuration file to define thePuppet master information:
        [main]

        Press Ctrl + X to close the Puppet configuration file, then type Y and press Enter to save the changes.
        Start the Puppet service and set it to launch on system boot by using:
        sudo systemctl start puppet
        sudo systemctl enable puppet


        Check if the Puppet service is running with:
        sudo systemctl status puppet

        Step 5: Sign Puppet Agent Certificate
        Using the Puppet master node, list all the available certificates:
        sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list –all

        Sign the certificates with:
        sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign –all

        2. Use the following command to test the communication between the master and client nodes:
        sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent –test
