        Configuration Management?
        In software development circles, configuration management refers to the process by which all environments
        hosting software are configured and maintained.
        Every development pipeline requires multiple environments for multiple purposes â€“ unit testing, integration
        testing, acceptance testing, load testing, system testing, end-user testing, etc. These environments become
        increasingly complex as the testing moves towards pre-prod and prod environments. Configuration management is an
        automated process that ensures the configuration of these environments is optimal.

        Puppet is a system management tool for centralizing and automating the configuration management process. Puppet
        is also used as a software deployment tool. It is an open-source configuration management software widely used
        for server configuration, management, deployment, and orchestration of various applications and services across
        the whole infrastructure of an organization.

        Four types of Puppet building blocks are

        Resources
        Classes
        Manifest
        Modules

        here are three kinds of resource types:

        Puppet core or built-in resource types.
        Puppet defined resource types.
        Puppet custom resource types.


        Puppet Classes:
        In Puppet, classes are code blocks that can be called in a code elsewhere. Using classes allows you reuse Puppet
        code, and can make reading manifests easier.

        Class Definition
        A class definition is where the code that composes a class lives. Defining a class makes the class available to
        be used in manifests, but does not actually evaluate anything.

        Class Declaration
        A class declaration occurs when a class is called in a manifest. A class declaration tells Puppet to evaluate
        the code within the class. Class declarations come in two different flavors: normal and resource-like.

        Puppet Manifest:
        Manifest is a directory containing puppet DSL files. Those files have a .pp extension. The .pp extension stands
        for puppet program. The puppet code consists of definitions or declarations of Puppet Classes.

        Puppet Modules:
        A module is a collection of manifests and data (such as facts, files, and templates), and they have a specific
        directory structure. Modules are useful for organizing your Puppet code, because they allow you to split your
        code into multiple manifests.
