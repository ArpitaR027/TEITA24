    Jenkins Master
    Your main Jenkins server is the Master. The Master’s job is to handle:
    Scheduling build jobs.
    Dispatching builds to the slaves for the actual execution.
    Monitor the slaves (possibly taking them online and offline as required).
    Recording and presenting the build results.
    A Master instance of Jenkins can also execute build jobs directly.


    Jenkins Slave
    A Slave is a Java executable that runs on a remote machine. Following are the characteristics of Jenkins Slaves:
    It hears requests from the Jenkins Master instance.
    Slaves can run on a variety of operating systems.
    The job of a Slave is to do as they are told to, which involves executing build jobs dispatched by the Master.
    You can configure a project to always run on a particular Slave machine or a particular type of Slave machine, or
    simply let Jenkins pick the next available Slave


    Go to the Manage Jenkins section and scroll down to the section of Manage Nodes.
    Click on New Node and give a name for the node, choose the Permanent Agent option and click on Ok.
    Step 1:- Go to manage Jenkins and click in mage nodes and clouds.
    Step 2:- Click on new node and give name to it and click on permanent agent.
    Step 3:- Configure it.
    Step 5:- After saving the configuration following window should be appear.
    Step 6: Click on Launch and agent.jar. After that some files will be download, save it.
    Step 7:- Open CMD where those files are saved . After that copy the second line from the output 5 and paste it in
    cmd.
    Step 8:- Now you can see slave is connected.

        What is Selenium in Devops?
        As a part of the UI testing team, Selenium test developers need to synchronize and orchestrate their test design
        and execution as per schedule and triggers, that are defined in their continuous integration or continuous
        delivery tools or platforms.
        Test Design needs to be more agile, effortless, and error-free. There is a shift towards the enhancement of
        existing or new test automation frameworks to integrate with continuous integration/continuous delivery
        pipelines seamlessly.

        Why to use maven in selenium project?
        It will manage your Selenium test project's build compilation, documentation and other related project tasks
        itself. It helps to create proper project structure,add and manage jar files in project's build path. It easily
        guides the project by gathering current principles for best practices development.

        Step 1: Click on new item, Give name to job and select maven project and then press on ok.
        Step 2: Now let’s configure the job.
        Step 3: After configuration click on Build now.

        Docker architecture
        Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the
        Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The
        Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker
        daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.
        Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.


        For install Docker we need following Commands:
        sudo apt-get update

        $ sudo apt-get install \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg \
        lsb-release

        Add Docker’s official GPG key:
        $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-achieve-keyring
        
        Now Install Docker Engine:
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

        Now we will perform operation on docker:
        For that we need use this commands:
        $sude su Doker image ls

        Git clone https://github.com/arpita770/docker.java.get 
        Cd docker-java
        Ls
        Nano Dockerfile
        Nano Hello.java

        Now we will Build Docker Image:
        For that we need following commands:- 
        Docker build -t rait-java-app .
        Docker run -it rait-java-app
        Docker ps 
        Docker ps -a
