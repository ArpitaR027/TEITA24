    <!-- What is DevOps?
    DevOps stands for development and operations. It’s a practice that aims at merging development, quality assurance,
    and operations (deployment and integration) into a single, continuous set of processes. This methodology is a
    natural extension of Agile and continuous delivery approaches.


    Higher speed and quality of product releases. DevOps speeds up product release by introducing continuous delivery,
    encouraging faster feedback, and allowing developers to fix bugs in the system in the early stages. Practicing
    DevOps, the team can focus on the quality of the product and automate a number of processes.

    Faster responsiveness to customer needs. With DevOps, a team can react to change requests from customers faster,
    adding new and updating existing features. As a result, the time-to-market and value-delivery rates increase.

    Better working environment. DevOps principles and practices lead to better communication between team members, and
    increased productivity and agility. Teams that practice DevOps are considered to be more productive and
    cross-skilled. Members of a DevOps team, both those who develop and those who operate, act in concert.


    Constant collaboration and communication. These have been the building blocks of DevOps since its dawn. Your team
    should work cohesively with the understanding of the needs and expectations of all members.

    Gradual changes. The implementation of gradual rollouts allows delivery teams to release a product to users while
    having an opportunity to make updates and roll back if something goes wrong.

    Shared end-to-end responsibility. When every member of a team moves towards one goal and is equally responsible for
    a project from beginning to end, they work cohesively and look for ways of facilitating other members’ tasks

    Early problem-solving. DevOps requires that tasks be performed as early in the project lifecycle as possible. So, in
    case of any issues, they will be addressed more quickly.

    DevOps Job Roles and Responsibilities:
    Let me first list down the various roles along with their description.

    DevOps Evangelist – The principal officer (leader) responsible for implementing DevOps
    Release Manager – The one releasing new features & ensuring post-release product stability
    Automation Expert – The guy responsible for achieving automation & orchestration of tools
    Software Developer/ Tester – The one who develops the code and tests it
    Quality Assurance – The one who ensures the quality of the product confims to its requirement
    Security Engineer – The one always monitoring the product’s security & health

    <!-- - What is Git?
    Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record
    of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration
    easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

    =Download Git for Windows
    =Browse to the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
    =Click the download link for Windows and allow the download to complete.
    =Extract and Launch Git Installer
    =Allow the app to make changes to your device by clicking Yes on the User Account Control dialog that opens.
    eview the GNU General Public License, and when you’re ready to install, click Next.
    =Select a text editor you’d like to use with Git.
    =the next step allows you to choose a different name for your initial branch. The default is 'master.' Unless you're
    working in a team that requires a different name, leave the default option and click Next.
    =This installation step allows you to change the PATH environment.
    Leave this on the middle (recommended) selection and click Next.
    =Depending on the version of Git you’re installing, it may offer to install experimental features. Unless you are
    feeling adventurous, leave them unchecked and click Install.
    =Once the installation is complete, tick the boxes to view the Release Notes or Launch Git Bash, then click Finish.
    =Git has two modes of use – a bash scripting shell (or command line) and a graphical user interface (GUI).

    =Launch Git Bash Shell
    =Launch Git GUI -->

            What is Maven?

            Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for
            projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT. But it is too much
            advanced than ANT. In short terms we can tell maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any
            Java-based project. maven make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the
            comprehension of any Java-based project.


            POM Files

            Project Object Model(POM) Files are XML file that contains information related to the project and
            configuration information such as dependencies, source directory, plugin, goals etc. used by Maven to build
            the project. When you should execute a maven command you give maven a POM file to execute the commands.
            Maven reads pom.xml file to accomplish its configuration and operations.


            In the Jenkins dashboard (Home screen), click Manage Jenkins from the left-hand side menu.

            Then, click on ‘Configure System’ from the right hand side.

            In the Configure system screen, scroll down till you see the Maven section and then click on the ‘Add Maven’
            button.

            Uncheck the ‘Install automatically’ option.

            Add any name for the setting and the location of the MAVEN_HOME. Then, click on the ‘Save’ button at the end
            of the screen.

            You can now create a job with the ‘Maven project’ option. In the Jenkins dashboard, click the New Item
            option.

            Now let’s Build Job for Maven
            Step 1: Click on new item, Give name to job and select maven project and then press on ok.

            Step 2: Now let’s configure the job.

            Step 3: After configuration click on Build now.

            $$Jenkins Pipeline

            In Jenkins, a pipeline is a collection of events or jobs which are interlinked with one another in a
            sequence.

            It is a combination of plugins that support the integration and implementation of continuous delivery
            pipelines using Jenkins.



           %% A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression to show your process for getting software for
            version control. Thus, every change made in your software goes through a number of complex processes on its
            manner to being released. It also involves developing the software in a repeatable and reliable manner, and
            progression of the built software through multiple stages of testing and deployment.

            $$JenkinsFile

            Jenkins Pipeline can be defined by a text file called JenkinsFile. You can implement pipeline as code using
            JenkinsFile, and this can be defined by using a DSL (Domain

            Specific Language). With the help of JenkinsFile, you can write the steps required for running a Jenkins
            Pipeline.


            Now we will build Maven project using Jenkins:
            Step 1: Create a new maven project with name maven_job
            Step 2: Now configure it.
            Step 3: After configuration we will click on build now.
            Step 4: Now we will create pipeline with name PipelineTomcatDeployment1.
            Step 5: To configure we will click on pipeline and type following code in script.
            Step 6: Click on build now and get the output.
            Step 7: click on pipeline syntax
            Step 8: Add credentials
            Step 9: After getting link from pipeline script we will post it into pipeline.
            Step 10: Pipeline is created.
